# Getting Started With CampFinderCO

CampFinderCO was created to allow campers from Colorado and around the country to discover, submit, and review dispersed or backcounty campsites. Feel free to check it out and let us know what you think!

The following steps are to set up and get started with the front-end of the project.

## Git Clone:

To start you'll need to have Mac vers or WSL2 set up.

Go to the following URL: https://github.com/andrrowens/phase-4-project-frontend

Next, click on Fork button at the top right of your screen.

Next, click on Create Fork

Next, click on the green <>Code button. A dropdown should appear. 

Make sure to select Local and SSH as shown in the image below and then click the button with two overlapping boxes located in the center-right of the screen. This will copy the SSH key for you.

Next, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to clone CampFinderCO.

Then type: 

> git clone

Then paste the copied SSH key from GitHub by right clicking or pressing command + v (Mac users) or ctrl + v (Windows users).

Once the SSH key is pasted press enter.

Then type:

> ls

Find the file "phase-4-project-frontend"

Then navigate into the project directory typing:

> cd phase-4-project-frontend


Then type:

> code .

This will open up the project repository in VSCode.


You'll need to install the dependency (library) for our front-end React application inside of a terminal that's opened within VSCode.

To do this type:

 > npm install

 This step may take up to a few minutes.

 Once that's complete, type:

 > npm start

After running npm start the homepage should open up in your browser!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
